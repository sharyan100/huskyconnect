    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      Amongst the midst of the Emerald City, there remains a critical unresolved issue: The Seattle Freeze. For those of you who are unaware, "The Seattle Freeze" refers to the difficulty in making new friends within the Seattle area. This aversion to strangers may arise for various reasons such as impoliteness, introversion or distrustfulness, however, can have significant mental health effects when not catered to appropriately. Particularly for UW students, from what we have heard and through our own personal experiences, it has been a struggle to make new friends within the majors and beyond. Although there are various social networking platforms such as Meetup, Facebook Groups and Bumble BFF, they do not directly address the challenge of making new friends within the context of UW Seattle. Hence, having to rely on registered student organizations (RSOs) or class activities is not the most efficient mode of developing new friendships. 
    <p/>
    <p>
      Potential implications include isolation, lack of social interaction and worsening mental health effects such as depression or anxiety. These are issues that can become problematic later on in life, especially for students once they enter the work force as professional networking and socializing are essential characteristics to develop throughout the years. To combat these social injustices, we were thinking of creating a web application that will allow students to find other students based on similar majors, interests, career aspirations, hobbies, residential areas and more. Having a platform where you are able to see other students’ profile might make it easier to reach out and create connections that wouldn’t have been introduced before!

    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
    <p>
      The users of the application will be UW Seattle students including freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. This might be hard to ensure as we don’t want to make students enter their student iD number or have to sign up using their UW email if they are not comfortable. This web application will be available in multiple languages and will have assistive technologies such as screen readers to ensure people with disabilities have equitable access to the platform. 
    <p/>
    <ol>
      <li>The first interactive feature includes creating a personalized user profile where they will have to fill out information about their interests, hobbies and background. They will have to upload a photo and verify it to ensure that the users are not automated bots and are verified individuals. </li>
      <li>The second interactive feature is a search functionality which includes various filtering criteria such as age, location, hobbies, academic interests, cultural background and more. Similar to Tinder, both users will have to match in order for the third interactive feature to be unlocked which is chat messaging. </li>
      <li>Once two users have been matched, there will be a messaging system for them to interact with one another. The aim is for them to initiate conversations, plan social activities and build connections that can be transferred beyond the school setting.</li>
      <li>The last interactive feature will be some sort of flagging system where the moderators can flag users that are not behaving according to the application policies and regulations. This can be used to remove any scammers, bots, or users who are using the app in any ill intent manner.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Hence, the information users will be viewing are user profiles including their profile picture, hobbies, interest, backgrounds and any other information they choose to put in. Similarly, users will also have access to their matched results so that they can evaluate potential friendship opportunities and decide whether or not they want to reach out to them. It is important to note that there will be a settings dropdown for users to manage their privacy, data security and location to ensure that their information is being safely stored, collected and used. Overall, this application will help resolve ‘The Seattle Freeze’ by providing a safe and secure platform for UW students to make friends within and beyond their major. This facilitation of friendships can help overcome social barriers as it fosters a sense of community that the university fails to provide. Beyond creating connections, we hope to mitigate mental health effects that may arise from lack of social interaction and isolation through this web-application.
